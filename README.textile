PyUnit provides a basic set of assertions which can get you started with unit testing python, but it's always useful to have more. Django also has a few specific requirements and common patterns when it comes to testing. This set of classes aims to provide a useful starting point for both these situations.

The application also overrides the default Django test runner, adding a few useful features:

h2. Installation

Just add the project to your INSTALLED_APPS.

<pre>INSTALLED_APPS = (
	'test_extensions',
)</pre>

Note that this application steals the test command from django, overriding it with extra toys. If another application in your INSTALLED_APPS does this too then the last one in the list will win. South migrations does this in order to use the django syncdb command for testing, which test_extensions does too. As of 0.4 test_extensions works with South, just as long as you include it after south in the list of installed apps.

h2. XMLUnit 

Sometimes it's nice to have a file reporting the results of a test run. Some applications such as CruiseControl can use this to display the results in a user interface.

<pre>python manage.py test --xml</pre>

h2. Code Coverage

If you want to know what code is being run when you run your test suite then codecoverage is for you. These two flags use two different third party libraries to calculate coverage statistics. The first dumps the results to stdout, the second creates a series of files displaying the results.

<pre>python manage.py test --coverage</pre>
<pre>python manage.py test --figleaf</pre>

h2. No Database

Sometimes your don't want the overhead of setting up a database during testing, probably because your application just doesn't use it.

<pre>python manage.py test --nodb</pre>
<pre>python manage.py test --nodb --coverage</pre>
